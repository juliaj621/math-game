# Math Game

Math Game is a simple terminal-run addition game that allows users to input names to start the game. Users will begin with 3 lives each and answer simple addition questions. If a user answers correct, they will keep their 3 lives. If a user answers incorrectly, they will lose a life. When one player loses all their lives the game will end and the player who still has 1 or more life will win!

## Getting Started

To run the math game in the terminal, simply input "ruby main.rb" and the game will begin!
